#Usability Test 1

## Goal
We want to find out if the test user can navigate through the application and find out where the user had difficulties.
For this we are going to observe the user while testing the mockup and let them fill out a feedback form. This form includes points about layout and placement of the buttons.

## Test 1 Scenario

You are the king/queen of castle Burgenstein and want to have your own little unit of guards. You decide to order those on "HiredKnights.ch". You want them to have light armor so they are agile, a sword and be mounted on horses for faster travel.

## Test 2 instructions
1. Go to the "Barracks"
   
2. Equip the knight with light armor, a sword and a horse as a mount.
   
3. Add him to the "Camp".
   
4. Go to the camp to see the which knights you have ready to be hired.
   
5. You want to add another knight so go back to the barracks.
   
6. Equip the new knight with heavy armor, a lance and no mount.
   
7. Add him to the camp and navigate to the camp.

8.  You only want 2 of the knights with the lance, so demobilize 1.
   
9.  You are happy now and press "Hire!".
    
10. Confirm the destination and the desired date for mobilization.
    
11. Congrats, you ordered something on HiredKnights
