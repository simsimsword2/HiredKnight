## Goal
We want to find out if the test user can navigate through the application and find out where the user had difficulties.
For this we are going to observe the user while testing the mockup and let them fill out a feedback form. This form includes points about layout and placement of the buttons.

## Test 1 Scenario

You are the king/queen of castle Burgenstein and want to have your own little unit of guards. You decide to order those on "HiredKnights.ch". You want them to have light armor, so they are agile, a sword and be mounted on horses for faster travel.

## Test 1 Results

### First Testrun

Test user:  Ella Froese\
Test date:  15.07.2021\
Observation:\
The test user immediately knew where to navigate to and was able to navigate through the website from the beginning to the end of the task. There was no hesitating and the order has been successfully placed.

Test user comment:\
"It was easy to navigate and also button placement was good."

### Second Testrun

Test user:  Patrick Jurt\
Test date:  15.07.2021\
Observation:\
The test user navigated through the website without any struggles. He instantly knew where to press and was successful at ordering.

Test user comment:\
"Everything was clear and it was easy to navigate. As soon as colors and a more detailed design is made it will be even easier."

### Third and Fourth Testrun

Test user:  Lea Jonas & Nick Kreuzen\
Test date:  15.07.2021\
Level of experience: Both subjects are occasional visitors of web shops and have moderate computer skills.
Observation:\
The test users were able to find all the buttons they needed to press with ease. One little hiccup occurred when they tried to use the arrow-button to the left
instead of the one to the right because it was closer to the text "Armor".

Test user comment:\
"The structure of the website is intuitive"

## Test 1 Evaluation

In general the design is good and the users know where to press to advance. Because the mockup for the test was built pretty linear the test was a bit limited. Still we could find out and see if the users struggled to navigate or not. The little "hiccup" with the left and right arrow is not an issue because in the finished product you would be able to press either the left or the right arrow to get the desired equipment.
Overall good feedback and nothing negative.



# Usability Test 2

This Test is not optimal for testing because the user is more or less guided through the test completely. It tells the user exactly what to to and that is a kind of influence.

Anyway we can test if the user knows where to click in which situation and find out if the button placement, names and sizes are good.
