 # Description

In this application the customers can design their own soldiers/knights. There are three different types of equipment they can choose from:
1. Armor Type
2. Weapon
3. Mount

Every soldier can only have one of each and cannot choose multiple of one type, for e.g. a sword and an axe as weapon.
Additionally the user needs to enter a quantity. As soon as the customer is hapy he can press the "Add to camp"-Button. The Camp is the equivalent to the shopping carts in other online shops.

In the camp the customer can see all of his added soldiers, sees the costs for every single type the customer put together and can also change the quantitiy of every type.

To hire the soldiers in the camp the customer must press the hire button.
