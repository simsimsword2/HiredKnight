 # Sort description
The client can design their own soldier. (Different types of armor multiple weapons.) After designing the soldier will be added to the “camp” (shopping card). 
The camp can be filled with multiple different soldiers and these soldiers can also be removed again.
If the client is happy with the camp all soldiers can be hired with the click of a button.

In this application the customers can design their own soldiers/knights. There are three different types of equipment they can choose from:
1. Armour Type
2. Weapon
3. Mount

Every soldier can only have one of each and cannot choose multiple of one type, for e.g. a sword and an axe as weapon.
Additionally the user needs to enter a quantity. As soon as the customer is hapy he can press the "Add to camp"-Button. The Camp is the equivalent to the shopping carts in other online shops.

In the camp the customer can see all of his added soldiers, sees the costs for every single one and can also change the quantitiy of every type of soldier.
